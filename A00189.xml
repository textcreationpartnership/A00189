            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Certaine aduertisementes, FOR A CONTINVAL ORDER TO BE obserued inuiolably without any alteration touching the pointes following, within the Diocesse of Couentrie and Liehfield.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>INprimis,</hi> for that the want of a sufficient Ministerie is not onely the Nurse of Ignorance and Popery, but also the cause of all Atheisme, disobedience, and dissolutenesse of life: And the corrupti≈ç of Patrons, aboundeth to the great decay of the sufficient maintenance of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, this setled order is set down to preuent either inconueniece wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of all Patrones together with such as are to be presented to Benifices, hereby without further intimation are to take knowledge within this Diocease of Couentrie and Lichfield, <hi>vz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That whosoeuer shall hereafter bee presented to any Benifice, shall attend for his publicke examination the first day of euerie moneth only, openly in the consistorie at Lichfield, betw√©ene the houres of eight and aleuen (if it be not a Sonday or Holiday) then the next daie following, where the reuerende Father in God the now Lord Bishop in person, or the Chauncellor at the least, or the Chauncelors Deputie giuing atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and calling for their assistance foure other Preachers at the least shall and will cause the gifts and learning of the partie presented to bee throughly examined, and presently vppon conference betwene them of his sufficiencie, to set their Iudgementes downe solempnly in a booke made and kept for that purpose, to notifie their allowance, or dissallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance. And for the better and more assured performannce of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement greatly heretofore neglected and abused, as well for want of appointing certaine sufficient and sincere Examiners vsually to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this charge as otherwise, the said reuerend Father in his now pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>posed Visitation will publish to the whole Countrey the names of such Preachers, by whose credite and conscience he will chiefly commit this charge and trust, besides the pretence of such as being alwaies n√©ere at hande may be vsed and required.</p>
            <p>And although the man for his learning shall be quallified, and bring besides Letters testimoniall for his good behauiour according to order, yet for that such Testimonialls haue by often and too much experience b√©ene proued to proc√©ed or hearesay, and importunitie of intreatie, with out any through knowledge of the partie so commended. Therefore the
<pb facs="tcp:12120:5"/>partie so presented and allowed as before, shall with license of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, repaire eftsons to that Parish, and aswell acquaint his Parish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with his persone as his giftes, that moneth onely, reading the first Sunday he commeth thither, this publicke aduertisement in time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Seruice. And so the first day of the next moneth following, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to the saide reuerend Father, or by his direction to the Office for his Institution, (if none shall vndertake to proue against him some notorious default that day of his apparance) and so without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to bee dispatched, giuing first his oath besides other matters, that neither by himselfe, nor any for him he hath vsed Simonie, in attaining to that liuing directly or indirectly, according to the Ecclesiastical laws in that behalfe prouided and established.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> Item, for that the lawes of this Realme do permit diuers persons sufficiently qualified and dispensed withall, to enioye twoo Benefices, and to demise the one to a sufficient Curate, it is likewise ordered that the first day of the next moneth after the Visitation ended, all the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, in, &amp; throughout the Diocesse of Couentrie and Lichfield, shal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at the Consistorie Court, where the foresaide reuerend Father in person, or his Chauncelor at the least, or the Chancelors deputy assisted with foure preachers, named &amp; published in euerie sessi≈ç of this visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with other such neere assistants, as shalbe called and vsed as before, wil be readie to sit for that purpose, and exhibiting their former licenses to the Ordinarie, if so be vpon this further triall and examination, they shall appeare m√©ete in all respects for that congregation, euerie circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance well waied &amp; duly considered then to be continued in the former place and seruice, otherwise to haue warning to depart, and the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent likewise to haue conuenient notice to prouide him of a more suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Minister within a reasonable time: And no Curate to be accepted or allowed in any Parishe without the license of the Ordinarie vnder his seale. Prouided further, that the licenses graunted to Curates shall not generally extend to any place vncertainely, but shall namely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the particular Parish whereto he shall be commended, and that al licenses contrarie to this order to be reformed. And further that no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, who are to supplye the absence of an other qualified by lawe, bee vsed as instruments onely by colour to defeat the good meaning of the Statutes in that behalfe prouided, to the benefit of Laie men, but them selues to enioy the commodities allotted to their owne better mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naner, according to the true meaning of the Statute.</p>
            <p n="3">

            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> Item, for that to helpe the lamentable inconueniences growing to the Church of God by the insufficient Ministerie, they are not onely to be sifted which are already made Ministers, but also a diligent care and foresight is to be vsed, that only sufficient men be admitted to that func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereafter. Therefore the foresaide reuerend Father would haue al and euery within this Diocease of Couentrie and Lichfield, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for themselues or their frendes, to sollicite for orders of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie to take knowledge hereby, that they &amp; euery of them must attend for publike examination and triall, the first day of euerie quarter of the y√©ere, onely in the Comistorie of Lichfielde, where the said reuerend, or his Chauncelor with the Archdeacons and other assistances and forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Preachers to be called, making due proofe by publicke examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all circumstances required by law, and immediatly setting down their iudgements accordingly, and if he or they vpon such triall shall be found worthy, then by the said reuerend Father to receiue orders, if the said reuerend Father shall thinke it so m√©ete and conuenient, otherwise either to be cleane reiected, or referred ouer to their further sufficiencie: and no prinate orders otherwise either to be sued, looked for, or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med within this Diocease of Couentrie and Lichfield.</p>

            <p n="8">
